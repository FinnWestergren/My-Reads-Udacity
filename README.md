Welcome to the "My Reads" application!

- Setup -

To install, navigate to the parent directory (My-Reads) in a terminal or command line and 
# run "npm install", then
# run "npm start" 
(I'm assuming you have npm installed, but if you dont... https://www.npmjs.com/)

A browser window should open automatically, and the application should load just fine.

- The Application -

There are 2 windows in this application:
    The List Page, which contains a list of all the books you've read, want to read, or currently reading.
    The Search Page, which allows you to search for new books and add them to one of the 3 lists mentioned above.

Each book listing on each page comes complete with an image and a title, as well as a dropdown menu button that will allow you to move the book into one of the lists (or remove from a list)

You will notice that if a book is already in a list, you can't move it there twice; that list option is disabled.

Enjoy my application!

# P.S. To spice up my application, I decided to employ react hooks, which was not covered in this course. However, I believe it was a worthwhile endeavor to learn both.
